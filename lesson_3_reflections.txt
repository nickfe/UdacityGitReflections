When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe I need to work not on one single computer. Maybe someone else need to coorperate.
    And in case my computer broke down or what what. I can keep a copy at GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    What if I made a change on my computer. Automatically update will recover it(since the change not on remote).
    Don't know whether I understand this question...
