When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe I need to work not on one single computer. Maybe someone else need to coorperate.
    And in case my computer broke down or what what. I can keep a copy at GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    What if I made a change on my computer. Automatically update will recover it(since the change not on remote).
    Don't know whether I understand this question...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork: like clone from other repository to my own (keep original information about the author)
    clone: clone from remote to local (pull from remote repository to local)
    branch: (when I work on some independent functions, I put them on different branches)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    could make less conflict since your work is on the basis of the remote one
